This repository contains JavaScript solutions to some problems from Project Euler.

This is just recreational programming. No claims of brilliance or efficiency: just fun, distraction, and maybe a bit of learning. When boredom strikes in, recreational programming comes to the rescue. Then it gets abandoned, because it's not that useful anyway.

It's also been an excuse to learn how GitHub Pages work. Problems I worked on can be visited at http://gpiancastelli.github.com/project-euler-js and their proposed solutions can be run directly from within the browser.
